Program Flow:

1. IndicatorSet -> Signal Datum Groups vs BarFreq ->    Run Strategy check ->   Yield Exec Datum at from smallest Bar to largest ->     Get latest order Datum and form OrderInfo ->    Contract on Order ->    ExecData Result ->      Position
                                                        a. OrderRules           a. Can Contain Several Orders


Coding Tasks:
==============

1. (addressed and need to test) Error Doji candle for Above-Daily BarTables when there is an incoming tick.

MarketData -> BarTableSet -> BarTable -> BarTableSet then run evluation
Bar.cs  ||  public bool MergeFromSmallerBar(Bar smaller_b)

2. (addressed and need to test) Fatal error casued by trying to save Above daily BarDatas

// Need to limit the scope for period change for BarTable with smaller than daily bars.
// public sealed class BarTableSet 
// public void SetPeriod(MultiPeriod mp, CancellationTokenSource cts = null)
// foreach (BarTable bt in BarTableLUT.Values.Where(bt => bt.BarFreq < BarFreq.Daily))

3. (done)(easy) Historical Headtime shall be based on Daily BarData's earliest time.

4. (done and tested 1st) Candlestick as SignalAnalysis

7. (done) PivotPt -> ApexPt

5. Pattern Momo-Reversal as SignalAnalysis, PatternSignal
    a. Count the uptrend lines and down trend lines
    b. Bar cross up and Bar cross down, and count visited levels
    c. Marubozu as momentum indication (red maru as bearish, white as bullish) --> long body as momentum
    d. Doji Star and hammer as reveral (T as bullish, shooting star as bearish) --> long wick as reversal

6. (just started) BarDataFile shall not always storage in Memory, but BarDateFileManager shall handle duplicated on-downloading files

13. The Calculation is triggered twice when Fetch Bars with connected IB. Need to fix

1. When Market Tick is feeding and start a new BarChart form, it won't align itself, and need me to manually click align all charts button to fix it.
2. If the BarTable is downloading from IB, which take a long time for multi sections of data, when accepting new ticks, please do not run calculation until all bars are downloaded.


1. Streamline TimeZone in Contracts: DateTime.Now.ToDestination(Contract.TimeZone), Time offset calculation!!!
2. Add Chart BarAnalysis for BarTableList...
3. BarTable status: ReadyToShow and Loading and Parital Calculating (Ticking) 
4. Enable non RTH option (identification...) loading... After Hour Chart, After Hour should be a parameter to the Fetching. and after hour bars are all should be loaded by IB API.
5. When programming is ending, I want the symbol saving and BarTable saving to be in the Task queue, instead of freezing the program during the last moment.
6. PSAR's last bar calculation has to reset the StartPt way back. Also missing PSAR value for the transistion Bar
7. Fresh by periodical keep up to date the table. ** HistoricalDataUpdate --- Need to test tomorrow.
8. Daily BarTable Fetch: Enfore the date range specified in the function
9. Is "LastDownloadRequestTime" really neccessary?
10. BarTable: LastTimeBound needs to point to DataSourcePeriod not bt.Period ???
11. Local Time error 
12. IB API Server down time 9:30 PM ~ 10:10 PM  IBConnected => Time is not between 8PM ~ 10PM
12. Status System






One solution is here:

1. Use IB's system time.
1. Use NTP
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

Trailing stop
Market Spread: Scalping, lower stop losses, aiming for lower profit. The higher spread, the lower (tighter) stop loss will become. 2% spread -> Risk vs reward ratio

All you need to know is the ID of the Time Zone you want to convert to.

An example (taken from the site):

DateTimeOffset nowDateTime = DateTimeOffset.Now;
DateTimeOffset newDateTime = TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTime(
    nowDateTime,
    TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById("Hawaiian Standard Time"));

Console.WriteLine("Now: {0}", nowDateTime);
Console.WriteLine("Now in Hawaii: {0}", newDateTime);
prints

Now: 3/5/2011 6:30:48 PM -08:00
Now in Hawaii: 3/5/2011 4:30:48 PM -10:00

To obtain a list of all the IDs, you can:

Check on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Time Zones
Query TimeZoneInfo.GetSystemTimeZones();

b) Selectable different update resources (mostly volume): Market Data / RTVolume / Realtime Bars
c) Refresh the BarTable with historical bars and override the realtime bars
d) Redo the calculation backward based on the updated bars (Get information from LatestCalculatePonter?, Index of b.Time)
e) Redo simulation periodically to determine the optimal strategy
